    "# File Handling in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "File handling is an essential part of any programming language. Python provides several functions and methods to handle files. Here are the key concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Opening a File\n",
    "\n",
    "To open a file in Python, use the `open()` function. It requires at least one argument: the file name. You can also specify the mode in which the file should be opened:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `'r'` - Read (default mode)\n",
    "- `'w'` - Write (creates a new file or truncates an existing file)\n",
    "- `'a'` - Append (adds content to the end of the file)\n",
    "- `'b'` - Binary mode (used for non-text files)\n",
    "- `'t'` - Text mode (default mode)\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "file = open('example.txt', 'r')  # Open a file for reading\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reading a File\n",
    "\n",
    "You can read the contents of a file using the `read()`, `readline()`, or `readlines()` methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "content = file.read()  # Read the entire file\n",
    "line = file.readline()  # Read a single line\n",
    "lines = file.readlines()  # Read all lines into a list\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Writing to a File\n",
    "\n",
    "To write to a file, open it in write (`'w'`) or append (`'a'`) mode and use the `write()` or `writelines()` methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "file = open('example.txt', 'w')\n",
    "file.write('Hello, World!')  # Write a string to the file\n",
    "file.writelines(['Line 1\\n', 'Line 2\\n'])  # Write a list of strings to the file\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Closing a File\n",
    "\n",
    "Always close a file after you are done with it to free up system resources:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "file.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using `with` Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the `with` statement is a better practice as it ensures the file is properly closed after its suite finishes:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:\n",
    "    content = file.read()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a complete example of reading from and writing to a file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Writing to a file\n",
    "with open('example.txt', 'w') as file:\n",
    "    file.write('Hello, World!\\n')\n",
    "    file.write('This is a file handling example.\\n')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Reading from a file\n",
    "with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:\n",
    "    content = file.read()\n",
    "    print(content)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these steps, you can effectively handle files in Python."
